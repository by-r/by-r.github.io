Hello! I'm Razzeq, and I enjoy learning, making projects and exploring new things. Also, having dreams of creating and contributing to meaningful projects that could have an impact in our everyday lives.

Currently working as an **Assistant IT Officer** at the local authority, [Perbadanan Labuan](https://www.linkedin.com/company/perbadanan-labuan/). Leveraging my skills of **Product Management**, **Product Ownership** and **Software Development**. **Handling**, **Developing Software** and sometimes doing adhoc **Graphic Design**.
